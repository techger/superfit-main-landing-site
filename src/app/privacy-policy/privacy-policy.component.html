              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Information That We Collect<br /></span></strong>
              </p>
              <p>Depending on how Users use App, we may ask Users to share their personally identifiable information
                ("Personal
                Information ") with us. Whether Users choose to share their Personal Information is completely up to
                Users, but
                Users must keep in mind that they may not be able to access some of the areas of App effectively and
                fully use
                the services we offer on our App without sharing adequate Personal Information. Personal Information
                includes
                any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact or locate the Users. If you send us
                information
                about another person, you must ensure that it is accurate and in good faith. Below are some of the
                situations
                wherein Users Personal Information is collected:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Account Information. Users may register on App and share their standard contact information. You
                  will also be
                  asked to allow SuperFit to collect your location information from your device when you download or use
                  the
                  Service. In addition, we may collect and store any personal information you provide while using our
                  Service
                  or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your name, address, email
                  address
                  verification and telephone number; other kind of identifying information. If you chat with other
                  SuperFit Users,
                  you provide us the content of your chats, and if you contact us at our customer service or other
                  inquiry, you
                  provide us with the content of that communication. SuperFit does not knowingly stores or saves any
                  kind of
                  personal information you share with other Users.</li><br />
                <li>We may collect Users/Members email address to send them account confirmations, notifications, and to
                  provide
                  services to Users in connection with the App. Subject to Users consent, we may also send to Users
                  promotional
                  emails, such as monthly newsletters, new service offerings;</li>
              </ol>

              <li>We also collect Users Personal Information for administrative purposes, such as addressing account and
                billing
                issues, troubleshooting App issues, investigating abuse on the App, responding to User enquiries and
                enforcing

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">How We Use Your Information</span></strong></p>
              <p>We use information that we collect about you or that you provide us:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>To present our App and its contents to you.</li>
                <li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us.</li>
                <li>To provide you with notices about your account, including expiration and renewal notices.</li>
                <li>To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between
                  you and us,
                  including for billing and collection.</li>
                <li>To notify about changes of our App or any products or services we offer or provide through it.</li>
                <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features on our App.</li>
                <li>For any other purpose with your consent.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>SuperFit uses IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are not used to track a
                User&rsquo;s
                session. This information only helps us determine how often different areas of our App are visited and
                the city
                in which the User is located. We do not link IP address to any information that is personally
                identifiable. <br /> <br /> We do not share, sell or buy personal information. We may share the Personal
                Information we collect,
                only with User&rsquo;s consent.&nbsp; The information submitted by users is used only for internal
                purposes and
                to provide quality customer service.</p>
              <p>However, we may release Personal Information or other information we collect, if we believe that such
                action is
                necessary to: (I) comply with legal requirements and processes; (II) identify, contact or bring legal
                action
                against persons or entities who are or we believe have caused or might cause injury to us or a third
                party; (III)
                defend or respond to claims brought or threatened against us, our employees, service providers, users of
                our
                Services or others; or (IV) otherwise to protect interests of SuperFit and of its employees, service
                providers,
                Users of the Services or others. Any such release decisions may be made by us in our sole discretion.
              </p>
              <p>While we try to be selective in working with third parties, we are not responsible for their use of
                your personal
                information. Where payments are involved, we must release your credit card information to credit card
                authorization
                service providers and associated banks to process your payment for purchases, returns or refunds.</p>
              <p>In addition, since member information on our App is a business asset, in case we are reorganized or
                sold to or
                merged with another company, we may sell, assign, or transfer your personal information to a purchaser
                of all
                or substantially all of our business assets, or to an affiliate, as applicable.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Using HealthKit</span></strong></p>
              <p>SuperFit shows you the following data from the Health app (HealthKit).</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You can input your bodyweight measurement manually, or synchronize with HealthKit to automatically
                  prepopulate
                  your fitness profile.</li>
                <li>Your completed workouts will add strength training and functional movement exercise logs to your
                  Health app which
                  contributes to your total activity profile.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can input your data manually, and the data is stored securely in the Health app. None of your
                health data is
                sent to any 3rd party services for any reason whatsoever.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Cookies <br /> <br /> </span></strong>We collect
                information
                via cookies and other similar technologies (such as web beacons). Your device sends these cookies back
                to the
                App every time you revisit it, so it can recognize your mobile device and personalize and improve your
                App experience.</p>
              <p>SuperFit uses cookies for the following general purposes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>To help us recognize your Apps as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may
                  have been
                  set while you are using our App. For example, if you register on our App, we may use cookies to
                  remember your
                  registration information, so you do not need to log into our App each time, you use it. We may also
                  record
                  your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Keep you signed in on your device unless
                  you
                  sign out. " Please note that user&rsquo;s IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included
                  in such cookies
                  are encrypted for security purposes.</li>
                <li>To help us customize the advertisements provided to you on our App and on other websites across the
                  Internet.
                  For example, when you access our App, a cookie is automatically set by us (our service providers, or
                  our partners)
                  to recognize your device or browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with
                  information and
                  advertising based on your apparent interests. To help measure and research the effectiveness of
                  features and
                  offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act
                  upon).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Our App may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny
                graphics with
                a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use
                Web beacons
                to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Apps to another, to deliver or
                communicate
                with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our App from an online advertisement displayed on a
                third-party
                website or App, and to improve App performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web
                beacons to
                help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and
                actions on
                our App. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings. If the Cookies are
                sent
                from third parties e.g. social networking sites, SuperFit shall not be liable.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Security<br /> </span></strong><br /> Please note
                that no data
                transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect the

              <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you
                have chosen)
                a password for access to certain parts of our App, you are responsible for keeping this password
                confidential.
                We advise you not to share your password with anyone.<br /> <br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;
